# Summer-School-Coding
This is a repo with all the code I built for my summer school computer science course over the period of 1 month. Majority of the code was built using Python. Assignments include:

1. Air Ontario; just a simple project with terminal input/output for displaying flight information
2. Pseudocode; just practice with writing pseudocode and translating it
3. Personality test; more pseudocode logic for developing a personality test
4. Tic-Tac-Toe; built a simple tic-tac-toe game using Tkinter
5. Virtual-Medicine-Home; full-stack website built using PHP
